#+TITLE: Emacs Config - Home
#+AUTHOR: Matthias Stein
#+DESCRIPTION: This is an addendum to init.org for the settings on my computer at home. 
#+STARTUP: overview inlineimages

My main Emacs configuration is in =conf.org=. These are the settings specific to my computer set-up I use at home privately, which is laptops running Debian or Ubuntu.

* Start Maximised
By default (at least on Ubuntu 20.04 with Vanilla Gnome), emacs starts ~25% screen size centered. To make it open maximised, I added the following:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'toggle-frame-maximized t)
#+end_src
* Personal Information

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Matthias Stein")
(setq user-mail-address "matthias.stein3@gmail.com")
#+END_SRC

* Org Agenda Folder 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/data/orgs"))
#+END_SRC
